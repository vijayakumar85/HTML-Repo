        <p>The Durand Football Tournament, known as Durand Cup, was started by Sir Henry Mortimer Durand in Shimla in 1888.[15][16] Sir Henry was recuperating from illness in Shimla in North India. Having become conscious of the value of sport as a means to maintain health, he decided to present a prize to encourage sporting competition in India. In 1940, the venue of the tournament was shifted to New Delhi.[15]</p>
